party:
*water genasi character I previously made
*human abberant mind sorcerer who is friends with him on the basis that the AMS responded back to his telepathic statement with sarcasm, causing pleasant surprise and leading to an almost brotherhood-like friendship.
*rogue -> soulknife at l3
*fire sorc/wiz/whatever who is fire genasi..normal human look except bright ginger hair..gets mad at everyone who implies something about him/her and fire as "against gingers"..
*fighter whose role is to tank...polearm master feat..polearm orientation. goal is to stand there, hurt and be hurt while blasters blast.

dev notes:
use list of objects with lists in it
for items and stuff, put in list [] but have variables that we change as necessary.

dice rolls d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d20,d100  as functions.to simplify we can set it to take a parameter num and it will be math.random * num. This cuts down the amount of rolls we needs to make. 
---------
**Instead of full charsheet, we'll get relevant bonus rolls per character and put them in the object.
We'll use individual charsheet pdf's to track chars.
What we'll track however is hitpoints and that sort of thing so that we can have attack/defense/damage/etc.
------------
Character interactions:
Gak and Derv are friends who met after a comical telepathic discourse where they discovered they both share that
Gak happened to also acquire his companions Jao and Blaze...Firstly through patronizing Jao in guild activities...His being a charlatan meant they worked together to blackmail merchants with Jao doing the dirty work and Gak bailing him out. This has cost Gak money and he lets Jao know it often. Jao therefore tries his damndest to get out of it by paying off the debt incurred.

Blaze on the other hand is a fellow genasi...something Gak could tell immediately. Knowing he has a child somewhere in the world that grew up alone, he treats Blaze as a sort of son to himself. This meant taking steps to protect Blaze from the corners. Eventually Blaze figured it out and confronted him on this. They have a sort of father-son bond that is only disrupted by their absolutely different personalities--Gak being cool and sly like water while Blaze is passionately angry and prone to unbecoming behaviors that Gak finds intolerable (such as his flaw of eating like a pig)

The last of the gangly bunch of Shump the Halforc fighter. Shump serves as Gak's bodyguard, originally just to fill the need of the con but later proven to be a good choice anyway.

Shump is a former captain of a detachment of Waterdeep guard sent to protect caravans to Mithral Hall. This command did not last too long because it was overtaken by other orcs and wiped out. Shump and the former cook were the only survivors, reporting back to Waterdeep in shame. While Shump desired to fight onward and fall in battle if need be, the cook persuaded him to report back and request reinforcements. Not being bright, but, having some wisdom, Shump did this. The response from leadership of the city was not forthcoming and he was put on leave. He now feels strongly negative about orcs more than he already did for his sufferings as the rape-child of a young human.  In a way, his behavior is like Jimmy Darmody from Boardwalk Empire: a former soldier who is over the glitter of idealism, having lost too many friends, and hateful of those that led to his circumstances.

For survival purposes Shump has been under the retainer of Gak, a purported Pirate Lord residing in Waterdeep. To Gak's surprise, many guardsmen recognized and gave deference to Shump....although not all of them have a rosy view.
