use arrays to hold info
array for names, subarray for health/dmg count
inputs in forms
add button adds to arrays, delete ships to "deleted items" array that holds info there but keeps it removed from showing
if works well, build in init like this

build vanilla first...then reactize and see which is simpler to implement with the current model.

------------
Dev note 1: to-do list functionality in vanilla js:
make function addTodo(event){
//prevent form from submitting if using in form
event.preventDefault();
//Todo DIV
const todoDiv = document.createElement("div");
todoDiv.classList.add("todo");
//Create LI
const newTodo = document.createElement('li');
newTodo.innerText = 'hey';
newTodo.classList.add('todo-item');
todoDiv.appendChild(newTodo);
//Check mark button
const completedButton = document.createElement('button');
completedButton.innerText = 'ajjkathkat';
//innerHTML if adding html for fontawesome
completedButton.classList.add("complete-btn");
todoDiv.appendChild(completedButton);
//Check trash button
const completedButton = document.createElement('button');
completedButton.innerHTML = 'fontawesome stuff here';
completedButton.classList.add("complete-btn");
todoDiv.appendChild(completedButton);
//APPEND TO LIST
todoList.appendChild(todoDiv);
}

Observations from Aug 14.
After dabbling in ChatGPT AI, it seems that progress was definitely possible.

We achieved the following goals:
*implement an intiative list system
*impelemnt a localstorage system
*remove other functionality that was not ready or helpful.

The dice-roller aspect is the most useful while the object side is so far behind that I have commented it out of the ocde for the sake of making things lighter overall. At some point when we master it, we will return to this task.

most common spell roller.
make it like attack but set internal math based on level and rolls --> outcome is accurate damage roll.
maybe for DC rolls, include half damage type stuff (like fireball).

an expansion on the above...why not set DC, AC, and have it make the comparison math and spit out hit/miss/effect.
for damage: show N + N +N +N = Nfinal for the sake of understanding
for DC: input to receive DC
for AC: input to receive AC
Equation compares d20 to DC or AC(depending on spell) and then runs the proper dice roll from spell and spells out outcome.
